									<h3>1921</h3>
                                	<p>Christopher Robin Milne gets a teddy bear for his first birthday. He first names the bear Edward, but after a visit to the London Zoo, he names the teddy bear after the bear Winnipeg. Later, he got several other stuffed animals that became Winnie's friends.</p>

									<h3>1924</h3>
                                	<p>Christopher Robin played a lot with his stuffed animal, this inspired A. A. Milne to write poems and stories about it. In 1924, the first poem appeared in When We Were Very Young. He then wrote the book Winnie the Pooh in 1926. The illustrations were made by E. H. Shepard.</p>

									<h3>1969-1972</h3>
                                	<p>In the Soviet Union, a version of Winnie the Pooh was made called Vinni Pukh. Pooh looked much more like a panda than a bear and he also got a completely different character, namely unkind and aggressive.</p>

									<h3>1961-2021</h3>
									<p>In 1961, Disney got the rights to Winnie the Pooh and since then they have released many different movies. The character of Winnie the Pooh in the books and movies is that he is naive, slow-witted and friendly. He also likes to eat a lot of honey.</p>

									<h3>2018</h3>
									<p>In 2018, Disney released a live action movie about Christopher Robin. In the film, Christopher Robin's stuffed animals and himself are not illustrated, but Christopher Robin is a real person and Pooh and his friends are animated plushies.</p>

									<h3>2021</h3>
									<p>Since 2021 Winnie the Pooh is a public domain, because it has been 95 years since the first publication. Disney has no longer exclusive rights, so independent filmmaker Rhys-Frake Wakefield made a horror film about Winnie the Pooh that will come out in 2023.</p>
